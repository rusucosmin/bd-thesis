# Experiment 2 - CIFAR

Distillation for CNNs, trying different values for the
temperature parameter and different architectures on the CIFAR10/100 dataset


## Pipeline

In the main file, main.py there is a pipeline for easy testing different architectures, training
both directly to CIFAR and using distillation.


## Model tested and results

### Teacher model

Class name: "Teacher"

### Student model

Class name: "Student"

### Student2 model
