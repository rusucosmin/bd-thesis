# Experiment 1 - MNIST

Distillation for CNNs, trying different values for the
temperature parameter and different architectures.


## Pipeline

In the main file, main.py there is a pipeline for easy testing different architectures, training
both directly to MNIST and using distillation.


## Model tested and results
