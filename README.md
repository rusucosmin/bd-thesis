# Bacherlor's degree thesis

This is my Bacherlor's degress paper.

The folder `android` contains the Android application files alongside the apk (app-debug.apk) for the application.

The folder `research` contains the experiments we run to test different mobile-ready convolutional neural network architectures. Every folder inside contains multiple experiments. Every experiment has its own command line tool that can be used to train, test and perform some statistics regarding the models inside.

You can run `python3 exp1.py --help` in order to see the available commands for each experiment.
